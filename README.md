## Takeaways

This was my first time ever working with SQL and relational databases. I was surprised at how simple it could be to make something that organizes data so easily! I liked the process of this and am interested in using SQL more. Something I want to change about this mini-project is the design-- I kept the design plain to focus on learning SQL, however I do want to change it at some point so it can be a nice experience for the user.
